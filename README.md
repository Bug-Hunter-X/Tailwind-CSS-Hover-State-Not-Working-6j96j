# Tailwind CSS Hover State Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS hover states are not applying correctly.  The issue is that while the Tailwind configuration appears correct, the hover state styles are not being triggered when the element is hovered over.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple div with Tailwind classes intended to change the background color on hover.  However, the hover state is not working as expected.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution to the problem, which often involves checking for CSS specificity conflicts or ensuring the correct configuration of Tailwind.
